  I learned to code as a student at General Assembly during the summer of 2015 in their Web Development Immersive program.  In case you are not familiar with General Assembly, it offers a full-stack web development program in twelve weeks, focusing on common best practices in object-oriented programming, MVC frameworks, data modeling, and test-driven development.
 <br>
  That means that in twelve short weeks my brain was loaded with information starting with the fundamentals: HTML and CSS, JavaScript, then jumping to Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Active Record, MVC frameworks, agile methodology, and more.  It was the most intensive and compelling learning experience imaginable, and it was more than I could have hoped for. I loved being immersed in code every day and working alongside my classmates, offering support (as well as asking for it), collaborating, and cheering each other on even for those “small wins”.   I want nothing more than to be surrounded by code and coders once again, to contribute my skills and expand on what I know.
<br>
  I am continuously working on my skills and gaining knowledge, which is the beauty of the tech industry – it’s always developing! I definitely have the desire to learn, work hard, and be part of a team that creates products that are not only enjoyable, efficient, and time-manageable for clients, but products they can depend on. While my professional coding experience may be limited, I do bring with me a pleasant personality and a customer service-oriented background that includes almost four years at the law firm and working in a high-volume, incoming call center in a mortgage company, during the fall of the mortgage industry.  Though these jobs weren’t my calling, I learned a great deal from them including being client-oriented and customer-pleasing. I have a strong work ethic and I am honest, patient and determined.
